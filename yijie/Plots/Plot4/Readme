### Decompress cosvarinvTT.rar first

This is the code for producing the plots for
1. C_l comparison of camb and emulator
2. delta C_l/cosmic variance
3. cumulative chi^2

for the MLP model that has:

N_layer=4

int_dim=512*512

no weight decay

lr scheduler: 1e-3 to 1e-8

0.1mil training points

rescale damping tails

in the gutted box
