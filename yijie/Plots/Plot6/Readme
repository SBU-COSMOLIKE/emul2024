### Decompress cosvarinvTT.rar first

These are files for creating plots for
  1. comparison between camb output and Chebyshev approximation of C_ell on ell=2-5000
  2. cumulative chi^2 of the approximation

You can change 'n': number of Chebyshev points to get different precisions. I demonstrated with 300 and 500 points
